  "rank1": [
    "Nobody is playing better football right now. That's just the facts.",
    "They look inevitable — not just winning, but removing doubt by halftime.",
    "The top spot belongs to them this week, and nobody is making a real case to take it.",
    "They're dominating in the trenches and staying clean in the margins. That's a scary combo.",
    "You can try to outscore them, but they can also grind you down. Pick your poison.",
    "Every week they answer a different question, and that's what elite looks like.",
    "The film says it, the scoreboard says it, the league feels it: they're the standard right now.",
    "They win ugly, they win pretty, and they win late. That's a complete team.",
    "If you're building a game plan against them, you're already conceding something.",
    "Right now, they don't have a weakness — they have preferences. That's dangerous."
  ],
  "rank2to5": [
    "Elite football. A legitimate contender. Just not quite all the way there yet.",
    "They're in the conversation. One big week and that could change in a hurry.",
    "Good enough to win a championship — they're just chasing the current top team right now.",
    "They have the talent, they have the coaching, and they have the belief. The finish is the last step.",
    "If they clean up one recurring mistake, they can beat anybody in the league.",
    "The ceiling is real. The question is whether the consistency matches the talent every week.",
    "They're winning, but you still see a few missed chances on tape that matter in January.",
    "This is a team nobody wants to draw in the playoffs. They're built for that environment.",
    "They can take over a game in a quarter. Now it's about taking over a season.",
    "They're close. Close is scary — and also unforgiving at this level."
  ],
  "rank6to10": [
    "A playoff team with real questions. That's not an insult — most teams wish they had their problems.",
    "They belong in this range. The question is whether they can climb when it matters.",
    "They can beat anyone on their best day, and they can beat themselves on a bad day.",
    "The talent is clear. The week-to-week identity is still forming.",
    "They've got a puncher's chance against the elites, but the margin is thin.",
    "Some weeks they look top-five. Some weeks they look ordinary. That's the story right now.",
    "They're dangerous if they start fast. If they start slow, you can steal it from them.",
    "They're winning enough to be taken seriously, but not clean enough to be trusted fully.",
    "The scheme is working — the consistency isn't always there. That's the separator.",
    "They're a real team. Now they have to prove they can be a real problem."
  ],
  "rank11to20": [
    "Right in the middle of the pack. They haven't separated themselves from anyone.",
    "Neither rising nor falling. A team still searching for its identity.",
    "One win from relevant, one loss from forgotten. That's the neighborhood they live in.",
    "They have strengths, but the weaknesses keep showing up at the worst possible times.",
    "You watch them and think: good roster, incomplete execution. That's the summary.",
    "They can make a run if they get hot. They can also disappear if they don't.",
    "The ceiling is higher than the record, but the floor is lower than the fans want.",
    "They're competitive, but not consistent. That's why they're stuck in the middle.",
    "Some parts look playoff-ready, other parts look like a weekly coin flip.",
    "If they want to climb, they have to start winning the close games — not explaining them."
  ],
  "rank21to30": [
    "They're building toward something. It's just not built yet.",
    "A tough stretch. The schedule doesn't get easier, and neither do the questions.",
    "They fight, but the errors keep piling up. That's what rebuilding looks like in real time.",
    "You can see pieces, not a machine. The machine takes time and a lot of good decisions.",
    "They're learning hard lessons every week. The only hope is that the lessons stick.",
    "The effort is there. The execution isn't. Until that flips, the results won't either.",
    "They need cleaner football and better answers in the fourth quarter. Right now they're short on both.",
    "This is a team that can upset someone — and then undo it with one sloppy sequence.",
    "They're not hopeless. They're just not there yet, and the standings are honest about it.",
    "The goal is progress, not perfection. But they have to show more progress soon."
