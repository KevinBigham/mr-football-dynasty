  "newStadiumOpen": [
    "New concrete. New seats. New atmosphere. The franchise didn't just build a stadium — they built a statement.",
    "The first home game in a new building feels like a first breath. Everything is possible again.",
    "The players walk onto the field and just stare. You can't practice for a moment like this.",
    "There's a different echo in a new stadium. The roar of the crowd hasn't settled into the walls yet.",
    "This isn't just a building; it's a promise to the city. A promise of a new era.",
    "The smell of fresh paint and possibility hangs in the air. Tonight, this house becomes a home.",
    "A cathedral of steel and glass, waiting for its first congregation to fill it with noise.",
    "The sun sets on the old stadium's memory and rises on the future, right here.",
    "From the luxury boxes to the nosebleeds, every seat has a perfect view of a franchise reborn.",
    "The pre-game flyover feels different today. It's not just a ritual; it's a christening.",
    "Years of planning, months of construction, all leading to this one perfect moment before kickoff.",
    "You can feel the city's pride radiating from the stands. This stadium belongs to them.",
    "The old ghosts didn't make the trip. This place is all about the future.",
    "The inaugural coin toss feels heavier somehow, weighted with the significance of a new beginning.",
    "The first cheer, the first touchdown, the first win. It all starts now."
  ],
  "capacityExpansion": [
    "Five thousand new seats, and every single one of them sold before the paint dried.",
    "When the crowd is this loud, the opposing offense can't function. They added more crowd.",
    "The stadium's roar just found a higher gear. That new upper deck is already shaking.",
    "It's standing room only in a stadium that just got bigger. That's the sign of a franchise on the rise.",
    "The opposing quarterback is already complaining about the noise. It just got 5,000 voices louder.",
    "More seats. More noise. More advantage. The math is simple.",
    "They literally raised the roof, and the fans are raising hell. What an atmosphere.",
    "This place was already a fortress. Now the walls are even higher, and the army is even larger.",
    "The expansion was built for moments like this: third down, game on the line, and utter chaos.",
    "You can feel the added weight of the new crowd. The pressure on the opposition just doubled.",
    "The franchise is growing, and the stadium is growing with it. A beautiful sight.",
    "Welcome to the new loudest stadium in the league. Hope you brought earplugs."
  ],
  "practiceUpgrade": [
    "The first day in a new training facility is quiet. Then the players get to work, and it gets loud fast.",
    "The best free agents go where the investment is real. This facility sends a message without saying a word.",
    "You can tell what a franchise values by how it treats its players' bodies. This is a commitment to excellence.",
    "The new weight room is a palace of iron and ambition. Records are going to be broken in here.",
    "A state-of-the-art hydrotherapy pool means players are fresher in the fourth quarter. It's an investment that pays off on Sundays.",
    "The film room is now a digital command center. No tendency will go unnoticed.",
    "The players walk in with a different swagger. This isn't just a practice facility; it's a competitive advantage.",
    "When you practice on perfectly manicured fields, you play faster. It's that simple.",
    "The message from the owner is clear: every resource will be provided to win a championship.",
    "The vibe in the locker room has changed. This is the look of a first-class organization.",
    "Recruits and free agents take notice. This is a destination now.",
    "Winning starts on Monday. And Monday just got a serious upgrade."
  ],
  "fieldSurface": [
    "Natural grass in late October, after a week of rain — there is nothing like it in professional sports.",
    "They switched to synthetic. Faster. More consistent. The traditionalists complained for exactly one week.",
    "The players' knees will thank the owner for this one. The new turf has give. It has life.",
    "There's a smell to a real grass field that you can't fake. It's the smell of football.",
    "The running backs are ecstatic. The new surface allows for harder, cleaner cuts.",
    "They installed a heated field. The snow will melt, but the opponent's will to win might melt with it.",
    "It's a chess match of surfaces. This new grass plays slow, favoring the home team's power running game.",
    "The debate is over. This hybrid surface is the best of both worlds, and the players love it.",
    "The first thing the players did was lie down on it. That's how you know you got the new field right.",
    "Rain or shine, the footing on this new turf is immaculate. A true home field advantage."
  ],
  "jumbotron": [
    "The new board is so large you can see the quarterback's eyes on the replay. The crowd has never been louder.",
    "When they installed the new scoreboard, the first thing they showed was last year's championship. That's how you do a reveal.",
    "The replay of that controversial call is 80 feet high and in crystal clear 4K. The referee is not having a good day.",
    "The crowd's roar on a big defensive stop is amplified when they see the hit again on the massive new screen.",
    "It's not just a scoreboard; it's a second coach, showing players what they missed on the last series.",
    "The visiting team tries to ignore it, but the sheer size and clarity of the new jumbotron is its own form of intimidation.",
    "The fan experience has been transformed. It feels less like watching a game and more like being in one.",
    "A game-changing play happens, and 70,000 fans immediately look up. The new board tells the story all over again.",
    "The visiting owner is looking at the new scoreboard with a notepad out. He's taking notes.",
    "It has changed the sound of the stadium. The roar for the replay is now as loud as the roar for the play itself."
  ],
  "atmosphereGrowth": [
    "You build a home field advantage one win at a time. After enough wins, the building itself starts to feel dangerous.",
    "Opposing coaches put this stadium on the schedule and quietly adjust their audible packages. It's that loud now.",
    "The crowd doesn't just cheer anymore. They anticipate. They understand their role in the game.",
    "It started a few seasons ago. A belief. Now, it's a tangible force. The stadium has a soul.",
    "This place used to be just a stadium. Now it's a fortress. The fans are the gatekeepers.",
    "Teams used to come in here looking for a win. Now they come in hoping to survive.",
    "The mystique is real. The players feel it. The opponents fear it.",
    "You can't buy this kind of atmosphere. You have to earn it, one deafening third down at a time.",
    "The city has fallen back in love with its team, and the stadium is the heart of that romance.",
    "This isn't just a tough place to play anymore. It's a place where championship dreams come to die."
