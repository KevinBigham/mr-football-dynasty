The tape on [PLAYER] has flashes, but the down-to-down detail is still developing.",       "If [TEAM] is taking [PLAYER] at [ROUND], they’re betting on traits over refinement. That can work, but it’s not risk-free.",       "The question is role clarity.

I also see the risk: [PLAYER] has to be ready faster than some prospects are.",       "Need fit is real, but so is competition level. [TEAM] will find out quickly if [PLAYER] can handle the jump.",       "If [PLAYER] is a plug-and-play, this is great.
