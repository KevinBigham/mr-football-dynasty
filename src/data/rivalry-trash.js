  spicy:["They talk about culture. We are the culture.",
         "They have the reputation. We have the results.",
         "Our motivation is the fact that they need us for a rivalry — we don't need them.",
         "Every time they schedule us they know what's coming. They schedule it anyway.",

          "The blood between these teams is real. The hate is earned. And we are ready to settle it.",
          "They've had this rivalry in their back pocket for years. Today we take it back.",
          "Some teams play for rankings. Some for records. We are playing for REVENGE."]
