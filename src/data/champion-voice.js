  "grinder": {
    "win": [
      "We ran the football and stopped the run. That's it. That's how you win championships.",
      "Offensive line, defensive front — they set the tone. Everybody else followed.",
      "We practiced the details. We executed the details. The result is the result.",
      "Ball security, field position, tackling. You do those things and you give yourself a chance.",
      "Nobody won this alone. It was a full roster job, from starters to scout team.",
      "We didn't chase style points. We played our brand for four quarters.",
      "We handled the moment because we handled Monday through Saturday.",
      "Enjoy it tonight. Then we start over. That's the standard."
    ],
    "loss": [
      "We got outexecuted in the second half. That's on me. We'll fix it.",
      "They were the better team today. We didn't do enough in the critical downs.",
      "We lost the line of scrimmage when it mattered. That's where it starts.",
      "Too many negative plays. Too many missed tackles. That's the game right there.",
      "We had chances and we didn't cash them. That's the difference at this level.",
      "No excuses. We didn't play clean enough to win a championship.",
      "We will evaluate every snap and correct the errors. That's the job.",
      "It hurts, but it doesn't change the work. We'll be back in this spot."
    ]
  },
  "professor": {
    "win": [
      "The preparation validated itself tonight. When you commit to the process, the moment becomes manageable.",
      "We didn't need surprises. We needed discipline, alignment, and execution — and the players delivered.",
      "Our plan was simple: reduce variance, win the situational downs, and finish drives. We did all three.",
      "I told the team all week: the fourth quarter would reward whoever stayed the most precise.",
      "We measured ourselves by habits, not headlines. Tonight, the habits showed up on the scoreboard.",
      "You can feel the difference when a team understands why each call exists. We played with clarity.",
      "We won because we stayed composed through adversity and kept stacking correct decisions.",
      "The trophy is a byproduct. The real win is the standard these players chose to live in."
    ],
    "loss": [
      "There were a handful of possessions that decided this game, and we didn't maximize them.",
      "A loss like this teaches you more than ten comfortable wins. We'll be honest about the lessons.",
      "We had a plan, but we didn't sustain our execution under the highest leverage.",
      "When you lose at this stage, it's rarely one thing. It's a chain of small errors that compound.",
      "We didn't earn enough clean looks in the areas that decide championships: third down and red zone.",
      "Credit to them — they adjusted faster than we did. That's the margin in a title game.",
      "We'll review the tape, identify the failure points, and rebuild the process with precision.",
      "Painful outcome, valuable information. Now we have to respond like professionals."
    ]
  },
  "hothead": {
    "win": [
      "They questioned everything — the scheme, the roster, the coaching. How's it look now?",
      "They told us we couldn't do it. They made jokes. We just held the trophy in their face.",
      "They wanted us to fold. We didn't fold. We hit harder, we finished, and we won.",
      "They said we were lucky. You don't get lucky for a whole season. You earn this.",
      "They doubted our guys all year. Those same guys just turned doubt into confetti.",
      "They can keep talking. We're the champions. That's the only quote that matters.",
      "They tried to turn us into a story. We turned it into a statement.",
      "They thought pressure would break us. Pressure made us better."
    ],
    "loss": [
      "I'm sick about it. They didn't take this — we let it slip with mistakes we can control.",
      "They made the plays at the end, and we didn't. That's the truth, and it burns.",
      "They'll celebrate, and they earned it. But don't confuse tonight with who we are.",
      "They capitalized on our errors. In a championship game, that's a death sentence.",
      "They outfinished us. That's the part that hurts the most because we know the standard.",
      "They got momentum and we didn't answer fast enough. That's on me to fix.",
      "They can have tonight. We're going to remember every snap that cost us this.",
      "They didn't break our spirit. They caught us with our guard down, and we won't repeat it."
    ]
  },
  "zen": {
    "win": [
      "We prepared. We executed. We won.",
      "Proud of the team. Grateful for the work. Enjoy tonight.",
      "They stayed present. The result followed.",
      "We respected the moment. We didn't fear it.",
      "Short week. Long season. Same focus.",
      "We played clean. We finished.",
      "Celebrate with the people who helped you. Then return to the work.",
      "This is a good night. Tomorrow is a new day."
    ],
    "loss": [
      "They made plays. We didn't make enough.",
      "We'll correct what needs correcting. We'll be ready next year.",
      "No excuses. No hiding. Just work.",
      "It hurts. We'll learn. We'll move forward.",
      "We didn't finish. That's the difference.",
      "Respect to them. Responsibility for us.",
      "Tonight is quiet. The work won't be.",
      "We'll carry it. We'll grow from it."
    ]
  },
  "visionary": {
    "win": [
      "This validates the model. We took heat for the decisions — the decisions just won a championship.",
      "We believed in the system when the noise was loud. The trophy is the receipt.",
      "We built for repeatable advantages, not vibes. Tonight the repeatable advantages showed up.",
      "People called it unconventional. We called it optimized. The result speaks for itself.",
      "We targeted efficiency, roster flexibility, and role clarity. This is what that looks like at the end.",
      "The data said our window was real. The players turned probability into reality.",
      "We won because our process reduces chaos. In this league, that's a superpower.",
      "Enjoy the win, then update the baseline. The goal is sustained excellence."
    ],
    "loss": [
      "The model liked our odds, but the game reminded us variance is undefeated. We'll update what we missed.",
      "We didn't lose because of philosophy. We lost because of execution in high-leverage snaps.",
      "There were scenarios we didn't account for well enough. That's on preparation, and we'll correct it.",
      "Our approach is built for long-run success. Tonight was a short-run outcome we didn't earn.",
      "We got exposed in a couple matchup zones we knew were thin. That's an offseason fix.",
      "The data doesn't prevent pain. It helps you respond intelligently to pain. That's what we'll do.",
      "We need to tighten the process where it matters most: red zone, third down, late-game decisions.",
      "We'll take the lesson, adjust the inputs, and come back with a better version of this team."
    ]
  },
  "firestarter": {
    "win": [
      "These players... they gave everything they had, every day, and tonight they got the reward.",
      "I don't have perfect words. I'm just proud — proud of their fight, proud of their heart.",
      "This team kept showing up for each other when it was hard. That's why we're champions.",
      "You watch them love each other, push each other, forgive each other — that's what won tonight.",
      "I've coached a long time, and moments like this still feel unreal. I'm grateful.",
      "This isn't just a trophy. It's every early morning, every rehab day, every quiet sacrifice.",
      "I'm happy for the families. I'm happy for the staff. I'm happy for the guys who never stopped believing.",
      "We did it together. And I hope the city feels how much we played for them tonight."
    ],
    "loss": [
      "I hurt for our players. They poured themselves into this, and I wish I could hand them a different ending.",
      "This one sits heavy. Not because of me — because of what they gave and what they deserved.",
      "They fought. They kept fighting. And it still wasn't enough. That's a hard truth to live with.",
      "I take responsibility. I asked them to believe, and tonight I wish I had given them one more answer.",
      "I'm proud of the effort, and I'm heartbroken by the result. Both can be true.",
      "We'll sit in the pain, then we'll build again. Because these players earned another chance at this.",
      "I told them I'd never stop working for them. That promise matters most after a night like this.",
      "It feels like we let the city down, and that hurts. We'll carry it, and we'll come back for them."
    ]
  },
  "dynastyCoach": [
    "I don't know if I could've done any of this without the players who believed before anyone else did.",
    "The rings are nice, but I'm most proud of the standard we kept when nobody was watching.",
    "I think about the assistants who became head coaches. That's the legacy that lasts.",
    "You spend your life chasing wins, then you realize it's the relationships that stay with you.",
    "The best teams I've coached were the ones that loved the hard parts of the job.",
    "I was never the smartest person in the room. I just tried to be the most consistent.",
    "We had great players, but we also had great workers. That's why we sustained it.",
    "I remember the early years when it was ugly. Those years built everything that followed.",
    "The city gave us patience, then gave us belief. I hope we gave something back.",
    "When people ask what it took, the answer is simple: time, trust, and a lot of uncomfortable honesty.",
    "I learned more from the losses than the parades. The losses kept us sharp.",
    "You don't do this alone. The staff, the trainers, the equipment room — they were our backbone.",
    "I'm tired in a good way. Like someone who emptied the tank for something that mattered.",
    "If there's one message, it's this: build it the right way and protect it every day.",
    "I'm grateful. That's the word. Grateful for the players, the people, and the years."
