/**
 * MFD Game Event Emitter
 *
 * Central event bus for the game event spine.
 * Collects events during a game simulation and exposes them
 * for reducer consumption and read-model generation.
 *
 * Design:
 * - Deterministic order: events are appended in simulation order
 * - Seed-safe: no Date.now() in hot path; timestamp injected from gameState
 * - Serializable: all payloads are plain objects
